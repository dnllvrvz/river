about the project: “Before investing we want to ensure that

the proposed dam designs are environmentally friendly and

being cost effective. Statkraft applies strict standards in all

ENDANGERING EXCEPTIONAL LANDSCAPE

AND BIODIVERSITY

N    ature has blessed Montenegro with the most beau-

tiful and scenic habitats with outstanding biodiver-

sity, which should be protected with the most strin-

gent environmental policies and scientific endeavour.

But in the last 20 years Montenegro`s concept of “eco-

logical state” has not prevented some heavy trade-offs

between nature and economic development, where

nature was short-changed. The proposed project on

the Morača was a step further in that direction.

It is a misconception that hydropower plants are be-

nign to the environment by default. They are “CO2

friendly” compared to fossil fuel power plants, but if

they are built without a thorough study of their envi-

ronmental impacts, dams and hydropower plants can

become one of the most destructive technologies. The

construction of dams on any river has several levels of

environmental impact, from the change to the natural

flow of the river and complete blockage of some parts,

to impacts on the reproduction of animal species and

their migration routes, which can lead to the almost

complete disappearance of local flora and fauna.

explored. Although the Government has not yet prepared

and adopted the Strategy for the development of renew-

able energy sources, it doesn`t mean that Montenegro is

without the great potential of other energy sources such as

the sun, wind and biomass.

While solar and wind energy are the cleanest forms of re-

newable energy, hydro energy is a desirable choice only

if it is justifiable from the ecological, economic and social

aspect. Montenegro, constitutionally defined as ecological

state, has the obligation to consider all potential alternatives

when developing its energy policy. But the National Energy

Strategy 2025 (NES25) doesn’t explore with the right weight

all the different options to meet the energy objective set by

the national strategy. While foreseeing the development of                               12% (2009) and 34% (2010) of domestic energy production. 2                          ergy output, especially on new hydropower development.

FAILURE OF THE THE MORAČA DAMS TENDER:

A VICTORY FOR NATURE IN MONTENEGRO

M     ontenegrin experts and public together with non-governmental organizations including Green Home, Forum 2010, MANS

and WWF, believe that the failure of the tender for the construction of four dams on the Morača River is a clear signal that

the Montenegrin government needs to turn towards sustainable energy solutions, which are in compliance with the country’s

status as an Ecological State and which are of benefit to the Montenegrin economy, people and nature.

The government of Montenegro should take the case

of the Morača dams as a warning that projects carrying

a high impact and a high cost should be carefully scru-

tinized at the very beginning to avoid wasting energy

and money.

The fact that no interested investors applied to the ten-

der for building a series of hydropower plants is a clear

proof of the economic unsustainability of the project

on the Morača, a fact finally realized by pre-qualified

investors after having carried out their first thorough

economic feasibility study. Several companies realized

this fact earlier in the tender process, shortly after see-

ing and analysing the government’s plan, and with-

drew from the project (Statkraft, Strabag and Synohy-

dro).

Throughout the tender process civil society organisa-

tions and independent experts from a variety of fields

insisted that the studies and analysis lacked important

data, that unrealistic predictions had been made, and

that environmental and social negative impacts were

simply too great for this project to be realized. Follow-

ing the failure of the tender, civil society is even more

convinced that the Morača project should be com-

pletely stopped.

Government officials, however, are still arguing that

the project’s viability should be reassessed notwith-

standing the failure of the tender. They might proceed

with the project in spite of studies demonstrating the

Our future will be secure only if tvhis generation makes sustainable choices and protects the beautiful nature in our country.
