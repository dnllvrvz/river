Executive Summary

Thanks to rich bird fauna, attractiveness of landscape and geomorphologic elements,

Montenegro has been attracting international ornithologists for more than 170 years.

Unlike the Skadar Lake for which extensive literature exists, for the ornithofauna of

Moraca canyon there are no scientific publications. It seems that during the history

Moraca canyon was rounded due to larger activities on the nearby Skadar Lake, swamps

of Ulcinj, Durmitor and Piva Lake.

Besides a fishing ban (Podgorica, some hundred meters between Vojni/Vezirov most),

and two Emerald sites, Morača canyon does not enjoy protection status in Montenegro.

However, Morača canyon / Platije was foreseen as a monument of nature by the Draft

Spatial Plan of Montenegro from 2006.

After a public debate, there were no remarks to the planned status of protection of this

canyon.

The final document of Spatial Plan adopted in the Parliament of Montenegro in 2008,

beside resistance of numerous institutions, civil sector, citizens and partially political

parties, Platije area was erased from the list of potentially protected areas and was

foreseen for building of the following accumulation reservoires: Zlatica, Milunovići,

Raslovići and Andrijevo.

In Montenegro, around 380 species have been registered; more than 40% of them does

not have satisfactory status. 297 species are protected permanently from 2006.

Many endangered species will be preserved by preserving their habitats. That is also the

best way for protecting them. The world’s authority for protection of birds and their

habitats BirdLife Inernational tries to conserve birds’ habitats through the implementation

of world wide program for protection called Internationally Important Bird Areas – IBA.

Montenegro has been part of the program since the beginning of its implementation in

1989\.

The activities on extension of the IBA list in Montenegro are continuing; the areas for

which data were not available are being researched. The result of this study is the list of

species and their number in the canyon (Table1), which represents the basis for

declaring “Morača canyon” a new IBA.

This canyon fulfils A1 and B2 IBA standards (see annex 2) due to 29 of 52 identification

species registered for IBA Montenegro. Only on the basis of presence of globally

endangered Pygmy Cormorant, Phalacrocorax pygmeus Platije canyon can be

considered as GLOBALLY important area for birds, which expands the national interest

for its protection.

From intensive research in 2008, excluding the winter aspect, in total 115 species were

registered in Morača Canyon (Tab.1). 84 certain nesting birds and 10 species whose

breeding has not been confirmed were registered in the canyon, which represents 42%

of the total number of species breeding in Montenegro (Puzović et al, 2004).

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


Research from 2008 in Morača canyon registered 115 bird species, while in the same

year 88 bird species were registered in the NP Lovćen (Saveljić, 2008). According to this,

61% of the total number of species seen in the Morača canyon is being registered in the

National Park Lovćen. Contrary to Morača canyon, National Park Lovćen does not fulfill

the status of internationally important IBA. In Morača canyon approximately 1,600 plant

species are being registered while in NP Lovćen the number is app. 1,500 (S.

Vuksanović, pers.com) (see graph.1).


112 species registered in the canyon have a kind of national or international protection

status: 32 species are listed in Annex I Annex I Bird Directive, 71 SPEC species of EU,

23 Emerald species, 108 species listed in the Annexes of Bern Convention, 45 from

Annexes of Bonn Convention, 14 species of CITES Convention and 7 species of AEWA

Convention (Table9).


The construction of any energy source disturbs natural state of environment and, in case

its impact is not carefully assessed, short-term and long-term consequences might be

drastic. This does not refer only to non-renewable energy sources, that are not eco

friendly but to each system for electricity production, either solar panels, windmills or

hydro-power plants.

Ornithological research realised during the course of one year and the published floristic

findings made evident that this study had to focus not only on the potential impact of

dams on Skadar Lake but also on the potential impact on such an important biodiversity

hotspot like Moraca canyon (as also recommended in the draft Montenegro spatial plan).

It is hard to predict the impact of construction of dams on Moraca River, because at the

moment there is no single document that describes their operation, i.e. how the water will

be managed. In other words it is not clear from the information released how the water

will flow through Moraca river (the main inflow of Skadar Lake), how much water will be

retained or released in which period of the year, and the resulting water regime during

the pelican breeding season. In short it is unclear to what extent all those activities will

influence the lake water level fluctuation. All these are unknowns that have to be solved

when planning the dams’ management and operation.

The construction of dams in Morača would drastically affect the condition of flora and

fauna of the canyon upstream of the dams and have enormous consequences on the

environment downstream.

The flooding of the canyon upstream would permanently cause the loss of habitats for

resting, reproduction and feeding of birds and would drastically change qualitative and

quantitative state of ornithofauna in the canyon. First of all, the species breeding in the

cliffs and feeding on river streams or pebble excavation locations would vanish. Then the

species breeding on high rocks and hunting in the more open section of canyon, such as

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


eagles, hawks, owls, numerous songsters breeding in the river bed and in low vegetation

or trees above the water, would also vanish.

An example of this type of impact and consequential destruction of plant and animal life

is the nearby river canyon beside Piva river and Pivsko lake, where no birds can be

found today due to loss of permanently flooded habitats. The whole river course of Piva

river was assessed for the identification of Emerald habitats in Montenegro (Emerald

data base from 2008), but only the part downstream of the dam, which is today in pristine

form, was declared as “emerald European network”. The upper flooded part of the

canyon did not fulfill the criteria of Montenegrin Emerald team experts.

The question is how the change of micro climate and geomorphology, caused by the

flooding of Morača, will influence two already declared Emerald habitats in Montenegro –

Mrtvica river canyon and Mala rijeka canyon. The flooding of parts of these habitats due

to the inundation of Morača itself is unknown. The loss of habitats and change of

vegetation cover, due to change of climate, will impact on the composition of

ornithofauna of these two canyons, already acknowledged as valuable by the Council of

Europe as Emerald sites.


Based on the facts presented in Part II and summarised in Table 8, it would be

intolerable to accept the impacts resulting from the construction of dams on Morača River

in the river canyon and the Skadar Lake. Such an activity would in fact be in contradiction

with the national legislation and international conventions that forbid the “destruction of

protected wild species, disturbance, reduction in number of population of protected wild

animal species, destruction or damaging of their habitats or changing of their living

conditions”, which would result from the construction of dams.

PART I

1. MORAČA CANYON


1. Background

Thanks to rich bird fauna, attractiveness of landscape and geomorphologic elements,

Montenegro has been attracting international ornithologists for more than 170 years.

The founder of Montenegrin ornithology Ludwig von Führer, who visited Montenegro

several times, in 1893/94 visited the Morača canyon but without recording ornithological

observations (Firer, 1894). The destination of his journey, as a guest of the Petrovici

Palace and Crown-prince Danilo, who was a passionate hunter, was Biogradska gora –

crown’s hunting ban site.

It seems that during history, Morača canyon paid charge to Skadar Lake, Ulcinj wetlands,

Durmitor and Plav Lake since there is no literature providing ornithological data for it.

When talking about Morača, ornithologists used to analyse the area passing through

nowadays Zeta villages and Morača’s mouth into the Skadar Lake.

Newer research of Morača canyon was undertaken in the period from 1999 to 2005 with

more often visits of Mrtvica canyon.



1. Ornithofauna of Morača river canyon

As already stated, there is no published literature providing data for birds of this canyon,

but the overview of bird species observed is given on the basis of twenty records made

by the author of this current study in the period 1999-2005 and 32 field-work days carried

out in the period between March and December 2008.

For easier presentation, upper flow of Morača (above Zeta mouth) is separated into

several observation points that would cover planned accumulations:

- Duklja - Smokovac
- Duga Monastery
- Andrijevo
- Morača Monastery
- Međuriječje

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


Duklja - Smokovac

The canyon is open on this profile; water is shallow out of season of spring-tide water

levels. The exploitation of gravel is intensive on those places. That causes blocking of

the river (Duklja) and creating small, isolated water surfaces.

During summer months, those places are bathing sites when disturbance of birds is

intensive.

Birds registered in post-breeding period are the following: Tachubaptus ruficollis, Little

egrett, Egretta garzetta; Grey Heron, Ardea cinerea; Pygmy Cormoran Phalacorocorax

pygmeus; Cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo.

Breeders in the river-bed are the following: Kingfisher, Alcedo attis, Common

Whitethroat, Sylvia communis. In the canyon, the following species breed on this site:

Aquila chrysaetos, Delichon urbica, Hirundo daurica, Hirundo rustica, Merops apiaster,

Lanius collurio, Lanius senator, Carduelis carduelis, Carduelis chloris, Fringila coelebs,

Serinus serinus, Oenante hispanica, Columba oenas, Sitta neumayer, Monticola

saxatilis, Passer domesticus, Upupa epops, Streptopelia turtur, Sturnus vulgaris, Pica

pica, Corvis corax, Coelus monedula.

It is interesting that both species of cormorant registered in Morača do not fly above this

profile.

Duga Monastery

This habitat is open and populated, having agro landscape and some places with prairie

vegetation. It is characterised by field species: larks Anthus campestris, Galerida cristata,

Alauda arvensis, Whinchat, Saxicola rubetra, and Northern House-martin Delichon

urbica which breed in a significant number of surrounding rocks, Barn Swallow, Hirundo

rustica;, Ptyonoprogone rupestris, hawks,           Accipiter nisus/gentilis, falcons Falco

tinnunculus / peregrinus, Common Scops-owl, Otus scops; Little Owl Athene noctua;

Eurasian Eagle-owl, Bubo bubo. In the summer 2008 it was breeding place for four pairs

of Burchinus oedicnemus. During the work on the 23 May, adult Golden Eagle, Aquila

chrysaetos, was registered flying upstream the canyon as well as Short-toed Eagle,

Circaetus gallicus. Most probably we are talking about one pair of Golden Eagles only.

To summarise, species registered on Smokovac are characteristic for this part of the

canyon, considering similar geomorphology. There are many breeders as Red Rumped

Swallow, Hirundo daurica in this part of the canyon.

Andrijevo

The only valuable record for this profile dates from 2002: Lanner Falcon, Falco

biarmicus. Its presence in this part of canyon probably attracts a few pairs of permanently

habited wild pigeons Columba livia. Here, the canyon is mostly closed which suits birds

the least.

Morača Monastery

This location, compared to others in the upper flow of the river is much more open.

Dominant habitats are oak and beech forests on higher altitudes, planted forests of black

pine and orchards.

The species of anthropogenic landscapes are dominant: Syrian Woodpecker,

Dendrocopus syriacus; Euroasian Hoopoe, Upupa epops; European Turtle-dove,

Streptopelia turtur, Red backed Shrike, Lanius colurio; Common Kestrel, Falco

tinnunculus.

Other frequent species are the following: tits Parus major/caeruleus; Robin, Eritacus

rubecula; Common Chiffchaff, Phyloscopus collybita; Green Woodpecker, Picus viridis;

Common Redstart, Phoenicurus phoenicurus; Common Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. At this

part, beside the species registered in Smokovac and Duga, the following species breed:

Emberiza cirlus, Parus palustris, Sylvia curruca, Sylvia cantillans and Luscinia

megarhynchos. Only White-throated Dipper, Cinclus cinclus has been registered as a

water bird on this profile.




Međuriječje

This habitat is characterised by mixed deciduous forest and open space in the mouth of

Mrtvica to Morača.

The only waterfowl registered in this profile in previous years is White-throated Dipper,

Cinclus cinclus.

The other groups registered are the following: Chafinnich, Fringila coelebs; tits Parus

major/caeruleus/palustris; Common Blackbird, Turdus merula; Chatterer, Garullus

glandarius; Euroasian Nuthatch, Sitta europea; Blackcap, Sylvia atricapilla; pigeons

Columba oenas/palumbus; European Turtle Dove, Streptopelia turtur; Cuckoo, Cuculus

canorus; Grey Headed Woodpecker, Picus canus; White Wagtail, Motacila alba. All

these species are linked to open and forest habitats of surrounding hills.

In 2002, in this part of canyon, Golden Eagle, Aquila chrysaetos, was registered. It

probably inhabited surrounding rocks. Hawks Accipiter nisus and Accipiter gentiles were

also registered.

From intensive research conducted in 2008 (excluding winter) a total of 115 species were

registered in Morača Canyon (Tab.1) (and additionally 15 more species in Mala rijeka

and Mrtvica – and thus the possibility that they exist in Moraca canyon is almost certain).

There were registered in the canyon 84 nesting birds and 10 species whose breeding

has not been confirmed. This represents 42% of the total number of species breeding in

Montenegro (Puzović et al, 2004).

1\.3 Morača river canyon, protection status

Besides a fishing ban (Podgorica, some hundred meters between Vojni/Vezirov most),

Morača canyon does not enjoy other protection status in Montenegro.

Out of international categories previously implemented in Montenegro, it has not been

recognised as IPA (plants), IBA (birds), IFA (fungi) nor as Emerald habitat of the Bern

Convention.




Figure 3. Water quality and the conservation level of the habitats in Morača canyon deserve special

scientific attention Photo: D. Saveljić.


However, Morača canyon / Platije was foreseen as a monument of nature by the Draft

Spatial Plan of Montenegro from 2006.

After public debate, there were no remarks to the planned status of protection of this

canyon.

The final document of Spatial Plan adopted in the Parliament of Montenegro in 2008,

beside resistance of numerous institutions, civil sector, citizens and partially political

parties, Platije area was erased from the list of potentially protected areas and was

Andrijevo (Ministry of economic development, 2007).


1\.4 Morača river, activities impacting on birds


Pebble exploitation, done in the downstream area of Morača River, is a significant

economic activity, impacting on bird population in the very river bed. Unlike sport fishing,

which has minimal impact, pebble exploitation significantly influences species breeding or

nourishing in the river bed.

Those activities, are carried out with the license issued by the Ministry of agriculture,

forestry and water management and are not performed according to ecological standards.

The river is being fragmented, isolated pools are being created as well as driving tracks

for the transport of excavated material. The water downstream of the pebble extraction

locations is always muddy.

The locations for pebble exploitation, upstream from Podgorica are the following: Zlatica,

Smokovac, Veziste, Bioce, Moracica, Duga, Mravinja, Mrtanja, Sujaci, Dromira i

Sjevernica, (Zlatičanin, 2007)

The results of uncontrolled gravel exploitation in the Morača river bed could be observed

in August 2008, when Morača river bed under the railway bridge of Duklja was completely

partitioned for the purpose of making a large pond, which was emptied through three high

profile pipes.

2\.                     SKADAR LAKE



2\.1 History of ornithological research

The first data on birds were recorded by the malacologist Küster in 1843, in his travelogue

“Montenegro”. He traveled from Cetinje to the lake and recorded simple species. The only

species worth of attention is Eurasian Griffon, Gyps fulvus (Vizi, 1981).

In the age of Austria-Hungary, royal officers used to hunt on the lake. The Officer Brander

created a small collection of birds of Skadar Lake (1890-91) and he granted it to the Land

Museum in Sarajevo.

The same year, the custodian of the Zoological Museum in Zagreb, Spiridon Brusina

organised a small collection exhibition for the Ornithological congress in Budapest in

1891, with the aim to show the birds of the lake to the world.

Montenegro, with its Skadar Lake and Ulcinj wetlands, became an obsession of Ludwig

von Führer (Fuhrer, 1894), founder of Montenegrin ornithology. He visited the lake several

times (in 1894, 1895, 1896 and 1934). Thanks to his work, Montenegro became one of the

states with ornithofauna which was studied the most at the end of 19th and beginning of

20th century.

In 1896, together with the custodian of the Land Museum in Sarajevo, Otmar Reiser, he

wrote the crucial work of Montenegrin ornithology „Ornis balcanica Montenegro“ (Reiser,

Fuhrer, 1896) that has not yet been surpassed for its seriousness, volume and

exhaustiveness of data.

After World War II, a new era of research of birds of the lake started: the Siniša Stanković

Institute, together with Sergej Matvejev, PhD in 1966 studied ornithofauna of Skadar Lake.

Frequent findings of ringed birds were published by the Institute for Ornithology of the

Croatian Academy of Science and Art in the scientific magazine „Larus“.

Croatian ornithologists Renata and Dragutin Rucner visited the lake in 1968 and published

their data in the scope of larger scientific papers.

The Institute for nature protection of Montenegro was established in 1961. Its employees

Božina Ivanović, PhD and Miro Iličković created the environmental collection of the

Institute. It was determined by Vojislav Vasić in 1967. In 1970, Ivanović, PhD published

„Ornithological observations on Skadar Lake“ (Ivanović, 1970).

The lake became more frequent destination of European ornithologists. They published

their travelogues: in 1961 Michael Terasse, in 1970 Burri and in 1974 Kempf and

Wersinger, and Ištvan Pelle and Obratil.

Travel agencies specialising in bird watching and ornithological destinations, such as the

British „Ornitholidays“, bring tourists and reporters who prepare valuable ornithological

documentation.

Darko Saveljić, Environmental risk assessment of the Moraca dams: ornithofauna of Moraca river canyon and Skadar Lake.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.



Many youth organizations such as Young Researchers of Serbia and Biological –

Research Association Josif Pančić from Belgrade, have organised camps on the lake and

published data in the Gazette of the Institute, Larus, Biosisteamatica and Archive of

biological sciences.

Vojislav Vasić was the first one to publish a check list of birds of Skadar Lake with 261

species. In the beginning of the 1970s, in the newly established Biological station on

Skadar Lake, Ondrej Vizi began ornithological work. He made a great contribution to

knowledge of birds and ecological regularities of the lake by publishing numerous works

and observations of the state of the lake, not only from the ornithological perspective (Vizi,

1978, 1981, 1995, 1997, 2003).

In 1991, IWC was introduced at Skadar Lake IWC (see 2.7)

In 1999, the author of this paper and Nela Vešović Dubak, ornithologist in the NP Skadar

Lake, joined intensive studies of Vizi.

In 2001, Saveljić and Dhora (AL) (Dhora, Saveljić, 2001) published the first ornithological

bibliography of Skadar Lake which today consists of more than 200 works.



2\.2 Ornithofauna of Skadar Lake


Beside Ulcinj wetlands in the south, primarily Salina „Bajo Sekulić“ and Durmitor in the

north, it is hardly possible to find more literature documenting an ornithological object as

for Skadar Lake elsewhere in this region.

In ornithological community, it is known as “European birds’ airport”. With its quality and

quantity of ornithofauna, it stands equally with Danube delta, Po delta, Guadalquivir,

Camargue and other European important bird areas.

So far, 281 bird species were registered in 18 taxonomic orders or 51 families (Dhora,

Saveljić, 2001). More than 30% of this number stands for wintering birds, the same for

passerines, more than 205 are breeding and residents are only 11% of recorded species

(Vasić, 1983).

This clearly shows that 90% of total bird fauna on the lake is mobile, i.e. it is not exclusive

ornithological asset of Montenegro but belongs to Europe, Asia and Africa.

All species are 100% protected on the lake due to hunting ban (NPM, 2001) (see 2.13).

On other habitats in Montenegro, more than 95% of bird species of the lake are protected

in some way: as permanently protected species or species protected by hunting bans

(Official Gazette of Montenegro, 2006).

Darko Saveljić, Environmental risk assessment of the Moraca dams: ornithofauna of Moraca river canyon and Skadar Lake.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


As will be described in the text, 150,000 birds winter on the lake. From this number,

numerous species make several percentages of European population of wintering birds.

More than one million birds fly over the lake in winter and during migrations.

The text provides the overview of ornithofauna of the lake belonging to the territory of

Montenegro. Territorial waters and lake’s shore in Albania are less important for the birds

than the Montenegrin side, especially considering breeders.



2\.3 Skadar Lake, protection status in national parks


- 1968 ornithological reserves: Pančeva oka (300 ha) and Manastirska tapija
- 1983 National Park (40.000 ha)
- 1989 IBA – international important bird area (40.000 ha)
- 1995 Ramsar – wetland of international importance (20.000 ha)
- 2006 Emerald habitat of Bern Convention (40.000 ha)

In Albania, the lake has the status of protected area V IUCN management category (see

Annex 3) and from November 2005 it is on the Ramsar list.

According to standards set by International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN,

Skadar Lake belongs to the II management category (see Annex 3). Those waters,

according to this category, are protected areas managed primarily for the purposes of

protection of ecosystem and recreation. The aim is to:

1. protect ecological integrity of one or several ecosystems for today’s and future

generations

1. exclude exploitation or occupations which are contradictory to purpose of declaring the

area and

1. provide base for scientific, educational, recreational and tourism potential, which all

have to be ecologically compatible.



2\.4 Ornithological reserves of Skadar Lake

According to the Law on nature protection and the Law on National parks, reserves are

the littoral or sea areas with unchanged or slightly changed overall nature, intended only

for conservation or genuine nature, scientific research without changing original elements

and biological diversity, monitoring of nature and education which is not endangering

realisation of free natural processes.

For research and visits to nature reserves for the sake of education, due to their

importance for protection, it is necessary to obtain a license from the manager. Economic

and other activities are forbidden in nature reserves.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


The first nature reserves in Montenegro were declared in 1986: ornithological reserves

Pančeva oka and Manastirska tapija. Their establishment was complete almost 15 years

before declaring the Skadar Lake as National Park. This clearly shows their natural value

and importance for protection of biodiversity.

Later, by the decree of NP Skadar Lake, Omerova gorica, Crni žar and Grmožur were

added to the list.

All reserves of Skadar Lake National Park were designated as zones of special interest for

protection, primarily as breeding areas for birds.

2\.5 Indicator species and breeders of Skadar Lake

Aside from its global importance as one of the largest European wintering areas for birds,

Skadar Lake is not lagging behind similar habitats in The Mediterranean when talking

about breeders.

More than 80 of 281 bird species registered on the lake so far have the status of breeder.

Total number of breeding population on the territory of Montenegro is 204. Almost 40% of

breeding population in Montenegro breeds on the lake.


The most important breeders of Skadar Lake are species selected as indicators:

Dalmatian Pelican, Pelecanus crispus; Pygmy Cormorant, Phalacrocorax pygmeus and

Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca.

The most famous and one of the most endangered birds of Europe and trade mark of

Skadar Lake National Park is the Dalmatian pelican, Pelecanus crispus. It has been

breeding on the lake even since the first ornithological records were made. That is a

species declared as (R(rare)) on the European continent, while globally it has status of

(VU(vulnerable)) (BirdLife International, 2000)

The pelican Pelecanus crispus is a globally endangered species. Its status has been

significantly improved by the largest European colony living in Mikra, Prespa Lake in

Greece, counting more than 1000 breeding pairs (Malakou, 2008). By qualitative

management in the breeding season (artificial islets that would prevent fluctuation of water

destroying the colony and excluding disturbance as an important factor of breeding

success) the pelican colony on Mikri Prespa has experienced a rapid increase in the

number of pairs and represents the largest world wide colony of this species (see Annex

4\.). This is the best example of protection of this species on the global level.

Figure 6. Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus) breeds on few centimeters above water surface of the

February water level Photo: B. Mitchell.


Pelicans breed in Southeast Europe, Middle East and Central Asia. On Skadar Lake, they

breed on floating turf islets in Pančeva oka reserve (see photo 6). Those islets are located

in vegetation of willow tree Salix alba, S. fragilis and other lake vegetation (Typha

angustifolia, T. latifolia, Phragmites australis). The colony is always mixed with Great

Cormorants, Phalacrocorax carbo; Pygmy Cormorants, P.pygmeus, and Little Egret and

Squacco Heron Egretta garzetta and Ardeola ralloides. Nests are located close to open

water because this heavy bird needs a runway for taking off and landing.

The second colony is occasionally located in Crni žar reserve. The colony is situated in

vegetation made of water lilies Nuphar luteum and Nymphea alba, and reed Phragmites

australis and water caltrop Trapa natans. Beside cormorants and herons, in colonial

breeding, Common Tern Sterna hirundo and Whiskered Tern Chlidonias hybrida join

pelicans.

The third location where pelicans used to breed (in the beginning of nineties) was

Grmožur. This rocky island is overgrown with vegetation in its centre (fig, Ficus carica,

pomegranate, Punica granatum and Vitex agnus-castis). Pelicans were breeding on the

pebble ground, only few meters away from open water.

These are exclusively fish-eating species feeding with small fish, mainly Scardinius

erythrophtalmus, Rutilus rubilio, Anguilla anguilla and Carassius auratus gibellio.

(Saveljić et al.2004))

As presented in Table 2, the breeding success of this bird in Skadar Lake is not at an

appropriate level for a viable population. A pair of pelicans successfully breeds a nestling

very rarely. The key reasons for failure are the flooding of eggs due to fluctuation of lake

water level, tourism and disturbance by fishermen, illegal hunters, birdwatchers and

ornithologists. This table shows that in only two years few pelican pairs had breeding

success higher than one nestling, which is unacceptable. Therefore, strict management

of their breeding is recommended and the installation of floating islets made of reed in

order to eliminate factors that might have negative impacts on their breeding success,

water fluctuation above all other factors (see Annex 5).

Pelicans nest in colonies on floating turf islets. Eggs are just above the lake water. Every

fluctuation of the lake water and disturbance of 12 kg weight breeders, causes flooding or

crashing the eggs, thus unsuccessful breeding.

The breeding colony of pelicans in Skadar Lake is the most westerly on the planet and

one of the most endangered. Having in mind that this population breeds in Europe with

some 2,000 pairs and global estimation is about 5,000 pairs (BirdLife International, 2004,

Wetlands International, 2002), the protection of pelicans in the lake and creating better

conditions for their breeding is seen as an imperative. This is primarily related to

preventing disturbance of the colony by fishermen, tourists and also scientists and

preventing lake water fluctuation. The surface of Panceva oka is 300 ha, making it too

difficult to install rafts that would be accepted as breeding sites. In photos 9 and 14 we

can see that Panceva oka and Mikri Prespa cannot be compared by size nor vegetation

distribution on the lakes. Unlike the Pančevačka oka and Crni zar, where during the

summer, the large number of small lakes inaccessible to rafts are being formed, pelicans

on the Mikri Prespa are nesting beside the open water, on the easily reachable micro

locality which allows building and placing the rafts in situ

In the hope of removing the negative impacts of water fluctuation, in 2001, the Centre for

protection and research of birds of Montenegro placed two floating platforms for their

breeding. If the rafts are accepted after 5 years, the project can be considered as

successful. Unfortunately, on the Skadar Lake the pelicans were nesting close to rafts

just one year, while in the following years chose to make colonies in the far more distant

places, even in the neighboring reservation Crni Zar. Anchored rafts made of wood are

movable only in the period of the highest water level, when all the vegetation in

reservation is under the water (and when the weather conditions do not permit navigation

on the lake). As the pelicans make colonies in range of 5 km in the lake (mostly because

of the disturbance), this creates problems for setting up floating rafts with 24 m2 in size

on the location beside the open water or at the small lake within the reservation and also

to be easily accepted.

Unlike pelicans, the state of the breeding population of Pygmy Cormorant, Phalacrocorax

pygmeus, is much better. This bird is classified as “secure” (S) in Europe, while globally it

is near threatened (NT) (BirdLife International, 2004, Wetlands International, 2002),.

Pygmy Cormorant, Phalacrocorax pygmeus is the smallest European cormorant. It has

limited range and breeds between Italy and the Caspian Lake. It is registered as nomadic

in central Europe and other states of the Mediterranean. In 1990, the global population of

this species was estimated at 21,965 to 27,285 pairs, out of which 2,500 pairs are

registered in Mediterranean countries.

In most of the countries where this bird breeds, the population is stable or growing, in

particular due to implementation of the Action Plan for protection of this species. The

largest breeding populations are registered in Romania (max 14,000 pairs) (BirdLife

International, 2004).

In Montenegro, Pygmy Cormorant breeds in three locations: Skadar Lake, Paratuk islet

on Bojana River and on Ada Bojana peninsula.

On Skadar Lake, it breeds in mixed colonies with Great Cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo;

Little Egret, Grey Heron, Squacco Heron and Night-heron: Ardeola ralloides, Ardea

cinerea, Egreta garzetta, Nycticorax nycticorax, and pelicans Pelecanus crispus. On the

lake, it breeds in Pančeva oka and Crni žar reserves and occasionally in Manastirska

tapija reserve. In 2007, a small mixed colony with cormorants was discovered in Ckla.

The colony from Pančeva oka moves on average every third year to Crni žar and back.

Most probably, the reasons are disturbance by tourists, setting fire to reeds in reserves

and disturbance by fishermen.

Pygmy Cormorant breeds from the beginning of April until June. There are 4 eggs in a

nest.

Nests are to be found in the trees of aider, Alnus sp. and willow, Salix sp., always on a

level beyond or together with the colony of its relative Great Cormorant, Phalacrocorax

carbo.

Water fluctuation can have impact on success of breeding if it is drastic, i.e. if it exceeds

30-40 cm in the period from March to June.

This bird eats only fish, mainly species less important from the economic aspect.

Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca has the status of vulnerable (VU) species in Europe,

while globally its status is even worse near threatened (NT) (BirdLife International, 2004,

Wetlands International, 2002),.

Aythya nyroca nests in some 18,000 pairs in Europe. Its area spreads to Central and

Eastern Europe, over Pakistan and India to Eastern China.

The global population of this bird does not exceed 120,000 pairs. The largest European

population is situated in Danube delta in Romania with no more than 6,500 pairs.

Due to drastic declination of number and stability of populations, an action plan for this

species was also prepared, as for pelicans and Pygmy Cormorant.

The number of breeding pairs of this bird on the lake is an estimation and does not

exceed 50 pairs.

There is less data on ecology of breeding of this bird on Skadar Lake and their

movements. It was less studied than other waterfowl.

Ferruginous duck breeds in vegetation of the northern part of the lake and is not strictly

connected to already mentioned reserves.

Often, it suffered its belonging to families of other ducks on the lake.


Beside above listed species, significant colonies of herons: Little Egret, Egretta garzetta;

Grey Heron, Ardea cinerea nest on the lake. Recently, two new species of herons, which

are the new breeders of Montenegro, breed in lake reserves: Glossy Ibis, Plegadis

falcinelus and Cattle Egret, Bubulcus ibis



2\.6 Important breeding sites in the NP Skadar Lake

As already mentioned, Skadar Lake is one of the most important European and World

breeding sites for certain bird species.

More than 600 pairs of Whiskered Tern (Chlydonias hybridus) make their nest on the

lake (Saveljić, 2004). They make their nests on all surfaces of the lake characterised by

floating vegetation. There are more than 20 colonies of this species on the lake. Based

on research, conducted in 2008 on the Albanian and Montenegrin side, one could say

that at least 1,600 pairs of this species breeds in the entire lake. This fact makes Skadar

lake one of the most important European breeding sites.

Grmožur is an important resting place and breeding site, first of all for gulls and tern.

Omerova gorica is the most important breeding site for Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea) on

the lake. This species nests on the laurel Laurus nobilis. Last years the colony has been

mixed with colony of Little Egret, Egretta garzetta.

Golubovo Island is the biggest breeding site for Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis).

Nests are in crevasse on the ground rocks, in scarce vegetation. The colony is mixes

with couple of nests of the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo).

Ckla is breeding sites for cormorants.

Crni žar and Pančeva oka are the most important colonies for heron on the lake, as well

as colonies for Pygmy Cormorant and Great Cormorant. Dalmatian Pelicans and

Whiskered Tern are also nesting on both localities, and there are also the largest

concentrations of nests of coot, moorhen, ferruginous duck and grebe.

Depending on the nesting ecology, it is important to point out the significant stratification

of colonial breeding sites on Crni žar and Pančeva oka:

The first level is occupied by pelicans. Their nests are floating and near open water.

Common coots, moorhens, grebes and terns are making floating nests directly on the

water. On the lower willow tree levels little egret, Squacco Heron and Pygmy Cormorant

are making their nests, while upper levels are left for Great Cormorant and Grey Heron.

The entire northern lake shore, which during the summer months gets overgrown, is a

breeding site of other bird species, which are very interesting from a scientific point of

view and in urgent need of protection. A dozen thousand coots breed in the reedbeds of

northern shore.

2\.7 Winter counting of birds on Skadar Lake – IWC

The winter counting of birds (The International Waterbird Census – IWC) has been

conducted since 1967 under the supervision of Wetlands International. This counting is

done in all water habitats worldwide.

Europe is the most efficient region in this activity and each year in mid January more

than 10,000 ornithologists and volunteers – birdwatchers, take part in this activity. More

than 15 million birds are counted during winter counting of birds in the wetlands of the old

continent.

The counting is done according to certain scientific and standardised methods and the

yearly results give an overview of the conditions of certain species and their population,

as well as of the importance that specific wetlands have for different groups or bird

species.

The results of IWC are sent to Wetlands International (an international non-government

organisation). The organisation each three years publishes the “Waterfowl Population

Estimated”, containing data on the condition of the population of 868 waterfowl species.

Results gathered through IWC are used for acquiring certain protection status in some

wetlands:

- IBA – Important Bird Area, more than 5000 habitats in Europe
- RAMSAR – Wetlands of international importance, more than 1800 habitats on the

planet

- SPA – Special protected area in European Union based on the Bird Directive

Winter census of birds on the Skadar Lake has been carried out since 1991 (Reports

from IWC 1991-2009). The activity was initiated by the Institute for Nature Protection of

Montenegro together with the Natural Museum of Belgrade. Later, when the Natural

Museum of Montenegro was established, the activity was taken over by the museums in

Podgorica and Belgrade, whereas now it is conducted by the National Park Skadar Lake.

Bird counters are professional ornithologists from Montenegro and Serbia, and IWC has

been done by teams with at least 3 ornithologists, to make sure that data is collected

accurately as much as possible. The counting is done with a small traditional canoe (čun)

or with a bigger boat along the predefined path. If the weather conditions are good (no

wind or rain) the counting on the Skadar Lake lasts continuously for 4 days. In case the

counting is interrupted due to bad weather conditions the data are considered valid, since

the flocks on the lake are quite steady and some of the species, especially sp, Aythya sp.

and Fulica atra are linked to certain areas or zones of the lake water.

Practice has shown that big and important flocks on the lake are movable only if they are

disturbed. As soon as the reason for disturbance stops, the flocks return to “their” waters.

Due to misunderstanding with the park administration regarding this activity, in 2005

counting was conducted by two teams: one from the museums in Podgorica and

Belgrade together with the Institute for Nature Protection from Podgorica and the other

team from Skadar Lake National Park together with the Institute for Nature Protection

from Serbia.

On 350 km 2 of the Skadar Lake two teams counted independently, along the predefined

paths but on different days. The data they gathered confirmed the reliability of the

method: the number of counted birds in two teams differed only in less than 2,000 birds,

which confirmed the effectiveness of the counting method used for the IWC. Moreover,

two teams counted the same number of species and birds in certain places (Reports

from IWC, 2006).


The results of the census done in January 2009, as presented in Table 3, show that the

number of birds in Montenegro, according to IWC, was one of the smallest since the

census has been implemented. The decrease, compared to 2008, was about 60%.

Approximately 49,000 birds were counted on Montenegrin side while in Albania, some

10,000 less birds were counted.

IWC on the Albanian part of the lake confirmed that large flocks, that used to stay on or

near the border, have moved towards the Albanian shore today. All possible reasons of

this kind of distribution of ornithofauna on the lake are at the level of speculations before

the implementation of multidisciplinary research of the biodiversity of the entire lake, the

water quality and quality of the lake benthos.

Figure 8. Waterbird counted in Skadar Lake from 1991 to 2009 / IWC programme.


IWC results clearly show the extreme importance of the Skadar Lake as a wintering site

for birds; the fluctuation of number of birds indicates clearly that something is going on

with the biodiversity of the lake which can be discovered only through multidisciplinary

research of the national park.

The biggest number of wintering birds on the lake was counted in 1999: 250,571 birds. In

relation to Ramsar criteria 3c, which set ≥20,000 of wintering birds as a criteria to be

enlisted as wetland of international importance, it is almost 13 times more. The smallest

number of birds visiting the lake was reported in 2006 when only 32,918 birds were

counted.

Regardless of the drastic reduction of the number, especially compared to 1999, the

Ramsar criteria 3c was not “broken-through”. The disappointing counting result in that

year did not reduce the importance of the lake as a wintering site.

On average, looking at the last 15 years IWC (without 2001/02/03), approximately

150,000 birds are wintering on the lake. That shows that the lake is one of the 5

most important birds’ wintering sites in Europe.

Despite the large number of wintering birds almost thirty waterfowl species, the majority

of which are wintering birds, belong to common coot, Fulica atra. In some of the years

their number comprised 80% of the total counted number of birds.

Beside the total number of wintering birds exceeding the Ramsar criteria 3c (≥ 20,000

wintering birds), Skadar Lake takes more than 1% of global population of some species

of wintering birds for wintering. Species such as Black-necked Grebe, Podiceps

nigricollis, exceeds 17 times the threshold set for declaring these waters as Ramsar site,

1. e. water of international importance, first of all as birds’ habitat.

The year 1999 has been taken as the most successful one over fifteen years of winter

counting on the lake and the one casting light on the importance of Skadar Lake.

2\.9 Migratory route over Skadar Lake and its international importance

With approximately 500 km 2 during autumn/winter/spring period, Skadar lake becomes

one of the leading transition routes for migratory species of Siberia, Central and East

Europe to and from Africa as well as one of the largest freshwater basins the birds use

for resting and renewing of energy during migration.

More than 1 million European and Asian birds passes over the lake during autumn and

spring migration and during wintering.

Almost 90% of total ornithofauna of the lake belongs to mobile part of ornithofauna. And

if they are not migrating they are considered as resident birds, however most of them has

double citizenship. It is not a rare case, and it especially refers to pelicans and

cormorants, that they make nests on the Montenegrin side (Crni žar, Pančeva oka) and

feed in Albanian territorial waters.

The data show that Skadar Lake, during migrations and wintering, hosts minimum 10%

of total East European and Central European population of certain species of water birds.

Forty findings of ringed birds from Skadar Lake, mainly killed by hunters or died in fishing

nests point to their origin: most of the ringed birds come from Scandinavian countries,

Central Europe and Pannonian Basin. Good part of them originates from Siberia.

Photo 10. Number of registered ringed birds caught on the Skadar Lake and corridors of

their migrations from the ringing location (Vasić, 1980)




Ringed birds belong to group of grebe, cormorants, herons, gooses, ducks, moorhens,

curlew and perching birds. Due to small number of findings and lack of ringing on the

lake itself, it would not be serious to make any estimations of where do the greatest

flocks of certain species come from, but the fact is that one of the greatest migration

corridors goes over the lake.

Mentioned facts clearly point to international obligations which Montenegro must fulfil by

preserving population of those birds as well as of all ecosystems of the Skadar Lake

National park.


2\.10 Wintering of birds on the Skadar Lake

As already mentioned in chapter 2.7, Skadar Lake is one of the most important wintering

birds’ habitats in Europe.

At least 6 species of wintering birds exceeds threshold of 1% of European wintering

population. Number goes up to 17%, as recorded on 1999 at Black-necked Grebe,

Podiceps nigricollis.

Results of the winter counting of birds (since 1991, with an interruption in 2001/02/03)

shows that on the lake water in the observed period at least 32,918 birds were wintering.

Official data from IWC are taken for interpretation of number of wintering birds. However,

one should have in mind that IWC is only “the current” state in the observed period,

usually during January.

Results of the observation for recent years point to the fact that often numbers on IWC

do not reflect real condition of wintering population, having in mind the fact that period

from December to beginning of February. i.e. the period when bird movements are the

smallest, is considered as “ornithological” winter.

Divergence in number of certain species in the observed period can be significant and

always in favour of larger number of birds.

Based on the previous research it can be concluded that on average the largest number

of Common Pochard, Aythya ferina stays on the lake in February. The peak of number of

Mallard, Anas plathyrhynchos is end of January and beginning of February; for Pygmy

Cormorant, Phalacrocorax pygmeus it is end of December, beginning of January; for

Common Black-headed Gull, Larus ridibundus it is end of February and beginning of

March while number of Common Coot, Fulica atra is mainly unchanged during winter.

Table 5. Number of five most characteristic internationally important and indicatory wintering birds of the

Skadar Lake National Park for the period 1991 – 2009.



Bird flocks on the Skadar Lake during wintering are quite fixed for certain parts of the

lake and there is no special mixing between them. Weak mobility of flocks can be noticed

at each winter visit. More drastic moving is caused by disturbance and flocks always

return to their previous positions after the danger or disturbance is over.

Contrary to the nesting period when they are near vegetation, during winter flocks stay

mainly on the open water. The position and density of the flock depends on disturbance,

water level and wind strength. When wind is stronger, for example flocks of Common

Coot Fulica atra, gather in very dense flocks which spread again after the wind stops.

The most dense flock of birds on the lake are registered in Pothum, all the way along the

Albanian border (probably due to minimal disturbance), and along the islets between

Petrova ponta and Beška, in aquatorium in front of Grmožur and in aquatorium below

Lesendro/Gornje blato.

2\.11 Ecological needs of some groups of birds on Skadar Lake

Depending on the ecology of a species, and based on the vegetation and water level,

there are various ecological zones on the lake which host birds (Šoti, Vizi, 1978).

Those zones are divided into:

- Zone of permanent water/high-seas
- Zone of floating vegetation (water lilies)
- Zone of wetland with meadows of emerging vegetation (like reed)
- Zone of wetland with willow trees
- Zone with meadows dry in summer

Southern shores of the lake are steep and rocky and belong to the special zone of

macchia and rocky ground gathering chordates and sometimes, during rest and hunt,

halcyons, Cormorants, herons, gulls and woodcocks.

Zones of permanent water are inhabited by birds in the periods when they do not

breed. All kinds of ducks Anas sp., Aythya sp., gulls Larus sp., and cormorants,

Phalacrocorax sp. and all kinds of grebes and mergansers, Podiceps sp., Mergus sp.

stay on the open waters out of breeding season and in winter. Common Coot, Fulica atra

is also on the open waters but could be found in other zones too.

Zones of floating vegetation (as water lilies.) and zones of vegetation with part in

and the other part out of water (emersive vegetation, such as reeds) are of great

significance during breeding period of wetland birds. Majority of waterfowl breeders,

except herons and cormorants, breed in those zones (see 2.6)

Zone of wetland with willow trees is situated along Morača on its estuary in the lake

and along the northern shore of aquatorium. This zone is important as occasional

breeding site of herons and cormorants (Manastirska tapija reserve, Bakine tigle) and

overnight stay, mainly for cormorants.

Zones of flooding meadows are the most important feeding and residence area of

herons and waders in migration and out of breeding season. In this zone, cormorants

occasionally hunt too, while they are important gathering places for common coots and

several kinds of ducks Anas sp. i Aythya sp. out of breeding period.

This is the key area for spawning of some fish species and breeding of amphibians in the

lake. Having abundant food (fish, amphibians, shells and grass), the zone of flooding

meadows has a key function in renewing the energy of birds tired of autumn and spring

migration.

The largest flocks of Garganey, Anas querquedula occupy flooding meadows around

Žabljak Crnojevića during spring migration wave.

The presence of birds in some zones is related to certain periods of the year: during the

breeding time, mainly from February to July, birds are tied to shore areas and to the lake

vegetation. Better conditions for breeding the nestling characterise those places: more

food, peace and possible shelter in case of predators’ attack.


40

Darko Saveljić, Environmental risk assessment of the Moraca dams: ornithofauna of Moraca river canyon and Skadar Lake.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


Depending on the species, some of them are permanently connected to vegetation, as

for example Common Moorhens, while some retreat towards the high-seas, as for

example grebe.

The zonation is clearly visible in Skadar Lake, in particular in winter months. However,

one should have in mind that birds are very mobile and that some birds use various

habitats hence areas. They could feed in one area, rest on a second and sleep in a third

one. Therefore, this division in zones has to be accepted conditionally and the fact that

birds are not strictly connected to certain zones but can use various ones for their

ecological needs should be kept in mind.


2\.12 Impact of water level fluctuation to some birds of Skadar Lake

Several factors influence quantitative and qualitative state of the ornithofauna of Skadar

lake. They could be divided into natural and anthropogenic.

Anthropogenic factors are mainly previous uncontrolled intensive hunting in the period

from mid August to mid March, illegal hunting, fishing regardless protected zones on the

lake, shipping and access of canoes and tourist boats to important resting, feeding or

breeding areas, water pollution, exploitation of mineral resources, illegal and legal

building on lake shores etc. Those factors have constant implications on the lake. In

summary the most important impact among the anthropogenic factors is disturbance as

a product of all human activities in the lake.

The most important natural factors are climate, trends of some species at a global level

and water regime. The issue of food quantities in the lake is a priori excluded by

multidisciplinary studies, due to the fact that Common Coot, Fulica atra, as an indicator

species is vegetarian for which there is plenty of food in the lake. The population is stable

in Europe and the number of Common Coot significantly varies from year to year.

Since more than 90% of ornithofauna of the lake is mobile (Vasić, 1983), climate has a

strong impact on the state of wintering populations and time frames of arrival, passage

and stay of birds at the lake.

A natural factor which has a negative impact, mostly referring to breeders, is the nest

inundation in spring months. This negative impact is well know by experts in this sector

and well documented in literature.

Pelicans breed on floating peat islets. Breeding starts already in February. Water

fluctuation causes flooding of nests, eggs and nestlings and is a crucial factor in breeding

success. The ecology of breeding of some waterfowl groups, beside pelicans, is

connected to surface vegetation and lake water fluctuation and influences their breeding

success (Podiceps cristatus, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Anas plathyrhynchos, Aythya

nyroca, Chlydonias hybridus, Fulica atra). That is partially related to great cormorants

and cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo/pygmeus.



2\.13 Bird hunting within the borders of NP Skadar Lake

National parks, according to the current law on nature protection and the definition of

International Union for conservation of nature (IUCN), are natural areas of land or sea,

determined to protect ecological integrity of one or many ecosystems for current and

future generations, to prevent inadequate utilization of natural resources or other

damaging activities and to provide base for scientific, educational, recreational and

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


tourism potential, which all have to be compatible with environment and culture. Activities

which do not endanger nature origins, landscape values are allowed in national parks.

Also, tourism/catering and recreational activities having the role of visiting and sight

seeing, agricultural and fishing in a traditional way are allowed. Any kind of bird hunting is

forbidden.

According to IUCN categories, National Parks belong to the II category of management

which support previously stated definition and role of national parks.

In the Law on National Parks, enacted in November 1991, hunting within National Parks

is not mentioned at all, but the article 19 precisely stipulates that “in national parks,

sanitary hunting of game” is allowed. However, going through the text, in article 36 is

stated that park wardens have the right and duty to “check the catch and hunting and

fishing tools and to verify if hunting, i.e. fishing is done in line with regulations”.

The lack of clarity of this law brought about many problems in managing hunting within

national parks of Montenegro, thus in Skadar Lake National Park too.

Generally speaking, organization of hunting in Montenegro, beside existing local hunting

associations and umbrella association – Hunting association of Montenegro, existing

legislation (Law on hunting in Montenegro enacted in 1999, Resolution on protection of

rare and endangered animal species, enacted in 2006) is not on a satisfactory level. This

is confirmed by the state of big and small game in ecosystems of Montenegro; many

species have all but disappreared.

An extremely long hunting season beginning on August 15 and ending on March 15, has

created a lot of damage and loss to fowl and other, not-hunted bird species in

Montenegro. At the end of summer, waterfowl shed and renew their feathers (mewing)

and get ready for migration. In that period, they are not able to fly. In the same period,

nestlings hatched in the respective year are still unable to fly and to avoid hunting bullets.

Skadar Lake is a landing runway during spring migration for all the birds that come to

Europe via the Mediterranean and fly further to the north of continent or to Siberia. Many

of them come in pairs from Africa. Hunting season which used to last until the middle of

March has drastically impacted on the state of some species, due to the fact that if one

bird from the parental pair was killed, the pair was not able to continue the species in the

respective year.

Because of the damage which bird hunting can cause during the spring migration, in the

EU a hunting ban is imposed from the middle of January (in many states even from 31

December). This fact is clearly underlined in the Second Environmental Review of the

Economic Commission of the United States referring to Montenegro.

The Spatial plan of special purpose for Skadar Lake National Park, which is a planning

document adopted by the Parliament of Montenegro in 2001, foresees a bird hunting ban

in the zone of Skadar Lake National Park.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


It seems that IWC results are a complex of negative impacts that have been registered

on the lake for more than 20 years. With their cumulative effect, they drastically affected

birds. Disturbance of birds by fishermen, hunters, illegal hunters, speedboats and tourist

boats contributed to this state. Speculation about lack of food on the lake are not realistic

because of the simple reason that the number of birds that eat plants (and by

eutrophication – the plant area is becoming larger), is decreasing. Taking into

consideration all the parameters, pollution of the lake water definitely becomes

secondary reason, if presence of humans and their acting on the very lake is considered.

According to the official statistics, in 2001, the year when bird hunting officially became

forbidden, Skadar Lake National Park earned 10,000 DEM (5, 128EUR) from local and

28,000 DEM (14, 358EUR) from international hunters (1 EUR = 1.95 DEM)

From the total income in 2001, Skadar Lake National Park earned 149,817 DEM (76,

829EUR) from hunting and fishing licenses, selling of confiscated hunting means,

renting water surfaces and restaurants and incomes from other sources.

Income share from “hunting industry”, if that could be considered as an industry at all,

considering that only in one year artificial breeding and releasing of ducks in the

hunting ground from the duck farm on Vitoja, was 25% or a quarter of total revenue.

Attempts of reactivation of hunting in the Park in 2005 failed because of a large public

pressure and drastic decrease of number of wintering birds on the lake.


2\.14 Activities in Skadar Lake National Park which impact on birds

According to current national and international legislation, national parks can collect

income from tourism and recreation, i.e. exclusively on the base of sustainable and non-

invasive utilization of resources.

Unlike previous years, when this Park was more oriented towards exploitation of natural

resources, primarily fish and birds, newer Park policy is more oriented towards tourism

and activities, which with necessary improvement – primarily adequate zoning of the lake

– do not cause a threat to the bird population (catch/shooting).

That is why the year 2001, when 25% of financial income of Skadar Lake National Park

was from bird hunting and last two years 2006/07 when the cashbox of Skadar Lake

National Park was filled with the income from other tourism activities and exploitation of

natural resources were taken for comparison.

It is important to mention that National Parks in Montenegro are not financed from the

state budget, therefore they are forced to self-finance. This fact significantly affected

deterioration of the situation in National Parks, in particular during the crises of the

1990s. In order to provide salaries for the employees and functioning of parks, the

administrations of National Parks were forced to allow exploitation of resources,

sometimes illegal. Nature reserves were affected: Pančeva oka (oil transport), Mlinski

potok (timber) etc.

recorded.

As it is shown, the administration of Skadar Lake National Park does not have special

records of the structure of visitors. There is no information on number of tickets issued for

specific groups of tourists such as bird watchers for example. There is no information on

age structure of visitors (adults, students, pupils) nor on number of the tourists staying

overnight on the lake shores.

In 2008, the amount for the entry ticket in the Skadar Lake National Park was determined

at 4 EUR with the possibility of visiting Visitors’ Centres in Vranjina and thematic centres

in Rijeka Crnojevica and Murici.


Since 2000, the state regarding financing has significantly improved, primarily due to

turning to tourism and sustainable use of resources.

Great interest of donors for the improvement of the state in Parks should be emphasised.

This mainly refers to Skadar Lake which gathered all major world wide donors: World

Bank, GTZ, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, GEF, WWF, UNDP, Euronatur and others.

In 2007, the lake was included in the national Biodiversity Research Program, mainly

referring to bird fauna.

3\. BOJANA RIVER AND SKADAR LAKE

Bojana River is the main effluent of Skadar Lake. In its 44 km length towards the Adriatic

Sea, Bojana receives water from Drim River and create the most important habitats on

800 km long Eastern coast of Adriatic.

Drim Rver that inflows Bojana few hundred of meters downstream from the lake, collects

waters of Black and White Drim i.e. watershed area of part of Kosovo and Prespa and

Ohrid Lake. Delta Bojana and Drim River is watershed for some 20% of overall water of

Balkan Peninsula.

Albanian part of Bojana River, as integral part of Skadar Lake ecosystem, in November

2005 was declared as Ramsar site, together with Skadar Lake. This was the first time of

official connecting of ecosystems of those areas which are indivisible by their

characteristics and ecological impacts.

Delta Bojana complies with several Ramsar criteria. On Montenegrin side, it belongs to

Emerald habitats of Bern Convention and IBA. Only in Ulcinj Salina, indivisible part of

Bojana complex, 15 bird species which exceeds 1% threshold of world wide bird

population are being registered.

Many species breeding on the lake in Bojana Delta find their peace in vagrancy and

wintering. Almost 3% of overall northwestern population of threatened Dalmatian Pelican

Pelecanus crispus visit Ulcinj Salina in post breeding period, between August and

November because of low level of disturbance, size of habitat and good condition of

feeding areas.

Darko Saveljić, Environmental risk assessment of the Moraca dams: ornithofauna of Moraca river canyon and Skadar Lake.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


Bojana River has a strong impact on Skadar Lake. It is its only link with Mediterranean

waters and the only corridor for migration of ichthyofauna.

Filling the Bojana River bed in 19th century significantly caused the increase of lake water

level. Since this change occurred 150 years ago, the state of the Skadar Lake water

surface as today could be taken as absolutely natural.

Every initiative for possible deepening of Bojana bed and lake water regulation would

drastically affect flora, fauna and lake water quality. Flotage of Bojana would threaten the

most important breeding sites of birds and permanently turn away dozens of dolphins

Trusciops truncatus which go into Bojana up to 20km upper stream.

All activities on regulation of lake water are against national legislation and Ramsar

Convention.

4\. MORAČA CANYON AND SKADAR LAKE – FUTURE IN LIGHT OF NATIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION, CONSTRUCTION OF DAMS ON MORAČA AND

THEIR IMPACT ON BIRDS


4\.1 Morača, potential IBA in Montenegro

There are about 9,600 bird species in the world. Among them, more than 1,100 are

endangered. In the last 200 years, due to human activities, 74 species have already died

out while many species are threatened by extinction.

Out of 526 bird species, so far registered in Europe, even 226 species or 43% do not

have a bright future. Among them, 35 species are globally threatened and near

extinction.

In Montenegro, around 380 species have been registered (approximately 4 % of the

global bird diversity); more than 40% of them do not have satisfactory status. 297

species have been permanently protected since 2006.

Many endangered species will be preserved by preserving their habitats. That is also the

best way to protect them. The world’s authority for protection of birds and their habitats

BirdLife Inernational tries to conserve birds’ habitats through the implementation of a

world-wide program for protection called Internationally Important Bird Areas – IBA.

Montenegro has been part of the program since the beginning of its implementation in

1989\.

Darko Saveljić, Environmental risk assessment of the Moraca dams: ornithofauna of Moraca river canyon and Skadar Lake.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


In Montenegro, until 2007, 13 IBA areas were identified in accordance with strict

international standards, that is approximately 10.6% of the total territory of the country

(Saveljić et al., 2007). For the identification of IBA, the locations for which literature and

recent scientific data were available were assessed. The surface under IBA in Slovenia is

approximately 35%, in Croatia 30%. As Montenegro is highlighted in the region because

of its geomorphologic features and climate diversity, it is expected that IBA covers the

surface of minimum 30%.

The activities on extension of the IBA list in Montenegro are continuing; the areas for

which data were not available are being researched. The result of this study is the list of

species and their number in the canyon (Table1), which represents the basis for

declaring Morača canyon a new IBA.


This canyon fulfils A1 and B2 IBA standards (see annex 2) due to 29 of 52 identification

species registered for IBA Montenegro. Only on the basis of presence of globally

endangered Pygmy Cormorant, Phalacrocorax pygmeus Platije canyon can be

considered as GLOBALLY important area for birds, which expands the national interest

for its protection.



If those standards are supplemented with the fact that 1,600 species of vascular flora

exist in the area, that is almost half of total registered plant species in Montenegro (Bulić,

2008), with more than 60 endemics of Balkan and 85 permanently protected species by

the Resolution of Nature Protection Institute, its is without any doubt that Platije canyon

in its pristine form fulfils the standards of Natura 2000.


4\.2 Morača canyon and nationally protected species

Intensive research of the canyon for the purpose of this study showed the presence of

112 protected bird species which is 37% of totally protected ornithofauna species in

Montenegro. If this fact is supplemented with 85 permanently protected plant species and

a number of representatives of Chiroptera order (bats), and other groups of plants,

animals and fungi, this canyon deserves special attention of scientific public in the aim of

its protection. Therefore, it was not surprising when the Draft Spatial Plan of Montenegro

from 2006 recognised this area as potentially protected area with the status of monument

of nature.


Research from 2008 in Morača canyon registered 115 bird species, while in the same

year 88 bird species were registered in the Lovćen National Park (Saveljić, 2008).

According to this, 61% of the total number of species seen in the Morača canyon is being

registered in the Lovćen National Park.

Contrary to Morača canyon, Lovćen National Park does not fulfill the status of

internationally important IBA.


According to the Resolution on protection of rare, endemic, and endangered species of

plants, animals and fungi (Official Gazette of Montenegro 2006) and the Law on nature

protection of Montenegro (Official Gazette of Montenegro 2008): “Animal and plant

species and their development forms, nests and hatches are forbidden to be removed

from their habitats, to be damaged and destroyed, i.e. coursed, disturbed, caught or

killed, and their habitats must not be damaged or destroyed”.


4\.3 Ornithofauna of Morača canyon, international conventions and directives

As already stated in part 1.2, according to intensive research in Morača canyon,

excluding winter aspect, a total of 115 species were registered (Table1), (and additionally

15 more species in Mala rijeka and Mrtvica – and thus the possibility that they exist in

Moraca canyon is almost certain). There were registered in the canyon 84 nesting

breeders and 10 species of birds whose breeding was not confirmed, which is 42% of the

total number of breeders in Montenegro (Puzović et al, 2004).

112 species registered in the canyon have a kind of national or international protection

status: 32 species are listed in Annex I Bird Directive, 71 SPEC species EU, 23 Emerald

5\. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF HYDRO-POWER PLANTS ON ORNITHOFAUNA OF

MORAČA RIVER AND SKADAR LAKE

The construction of any energy source disturbs natural state of environment and, in case

its impact is not carefully assessed, short-term and long-term consequences might be

drastic. This does not refer only to non-renewable energy sources, that are not eco

friendly but to each system for electricity production, either solar panels, windmills or

hydro-power plants.

Because of the disruption of natural balance during the construction and eventual

functioning, based on the most important EU acts related to nature protection (Habitat

and Bird Directive), the obligation of environmental impact assessment is necessary

during the installation of energy sources.

It was already mentioned (see 1.1) that no published data exist on the ornithofauna of

Morača canyon before the elaboration of this study. In the meantime, two important

doctoral theses were published in 2008 (Bulić, 2008, Dragićević, 2008) which presented

numerous data on floristic values of Morača canyon (see 4.1).

Ornithological research realised during the course of one year and the published floristic

findings made evident that this study had to focus not only on the potential impact of

dams on Skadar lake but also on the potential impact on such an important biodiversity

hotspot like Moraca canyon (as also recommended in the draft Montenegro spatial plan).

Designing measures for mitigation of negative impact of construction of dams on Morača

on the Skadar Lake is unacceptable due to extraordinary high biological diversity values

of the canyon – from both floristic and ornithological aspect. Morača canyon with its

floristic and ornithological assets exceeds the significance of Lovćen mountain (declared

a national park in 1952) in the number of species hence should be preserved as a unique

natural asset of the country.

It was already mentioned that in Morača canyon, 115 bird species are being registered,

while in national park Lovćen only 88. In Morača canyon approximately 1,600 plant

species are being registered while in Lovćen the number is approximately 1,500 (S.

Vuksanović, pers.com) (see graph.1).



5\.1 Pelicans and dams on Morača river

The Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus) is the most famous and charismatic bird of

Skadar Lake National Park as well as the trademark of the park. It is one of the most

endangered birds in Europe and its breeding in the lake has been reported since the first

ornithological records were made. According to Birdlife it is a species classified as rare


52

Darko Saveljić, Environmental risk assessment of the Moraca dams: ornithofauna of Moraca river canyon and Skadar Lake.

Report for WWF Mediterranean Programme.


(R) in the European continent, and vulnerable (VU) at a global scale (BirdLife

International, 2000) (see chapter 2.5)

The breeding colony of pelicans on Skadar Lake is the most far western on the planet

and one of the most endangered due to the very low population numbers and low

reproductive success. The European breeding population accounts around 2,000 pairs

and the global estimate accounts for about 5,000 pairs in total (BirdLife International,

2004, Wetlands International, 2002).

Unfortunately, every successful story on the protection of pelicans and increase of

number of breeding pairs is linked to management, primarily the management of the

wetland water level where they breed, and the management of the nests – by

establishment of floating rafts. Two large colonies are in Romania (Danube Delta) and

Greece (Mikri Prespa). A dramatic growth of number of pairs, especially in Mikri Prespa

(see Annex 4) is exactly related to management. Construction of artificial islets for

breeding, in order to prevent flooding of eggs, and limiting the access to colony in the

breeding season lead to significant increase of number of breeding pairs. Thus, the

colony on Mikri Prespa is the largest colony of this species. The growth of number of

pairs and similar management is done on the Romanian side of Danube Delta.

It was already stated (see Table 2) that the main reason of bad result of breeding of

Dalmatian Pelican on Skadar Lake is human disturbance and inundation of nests during

the breeding season.

It is hard to predict the impact of construction of dams on Moraca River, because at the

moment there is no public document that describes their operation, i.e. how the water will

be managed. In other words it is not clear from the information released how the water

will flow through Moraca river (the main inflow of Skadar Lake), how much water will be

retained or released in which period of the year, and the resulting water regime during

the pelican breeding season. In short it is unclear to what extent all those activities will

influence the lake water level fluctuation. All these are unknowns that have to be solved

when planning the dams management and operation.

At the moment the only possible management response for improving the state of the

pelican colony is i) the active protection of the colony, disabling any kind of access to it

(even ornithologists and bird watchers) until the beginning of July (building on the

successful experience in Mikri Prespa); ii) preventing disturbance from illegal

hunters/fishermen; iii) patrolling the lake with guards; and iv) building floating rafts that

will prevent the negative impact of precipitation (hence flooding of nests) during the

breeding season. More investigations on the impact of dams on Moraca on the water

regime in the pelican breeding sites are needed.

Based on results obtained through the work of this study, and based on the floristic data

published in 2008, the following findings are made:

- The canyon fulfills A1 standard of globally important bird area;
- 115 species were registered in Morača Canyon (Tab.1);
- 84 bird species have been recorded to breed in the canyon;
- For 10 bird species the breeding is not confirmed but potentially expected;
- 29 out of 52 species eligible for declaring an Important Bird Area of Montenegro are

registered in the canyon

- 112 protected bird species or 42% of the total number of protected bird species in

Montenegro are found in the canyon

- 32 species are listed in Annex I of the Bird Directive
- 71 species are Species of European Conservation Concern (SPEC) (see annex 1)
- 23 species are Emerald species
- 108 species are listed in Bern Convention
- 45 species are listed in Bonn Convention
- 14 species are listed in CITES Convention;
- 7 species are listed in the AEWA Convention;
- The canyon is habitat for app. 1600 species of vascular flora (which is half of the

number of total number of registered species in the country);

- More than 60 Balkan endemic plant species;
- More than 85 permanently protected plant species;
- Mrtvica River canyon and Mala rijeka canyon (affluents in Morača canyon) are

Emerald site, protected according to international standards.

6\. CONCLUSION

The construction of dams in Morača would drastically impact on the condition of flora and

fauna of the canyon upstream of the dams and have enormous consequences on the

environment downstream.

The flooding of the canyon upstream would permanently cause the loss of habitats for

resting, reproduction and feeding of birds and would drastically change the qualitative

and quantitative state of ornithofauna in the canyon. First of all, the species breeding in

the cliffs and feeding on river streams or pebble excavation locations would vanish. Then

the species breeding on high rocks and hunting in the more open section of the canyon,

such as eagles, hawks, owls, numerous songsters breeding in the river bed and in low

vegetation or trees above the water, would also vanish.

An example of this type of impact and consequent destruction of plant and animal life is

the nearby river canyon beside Piva river and Pivsko lake, where no birds can be found

today due to loss of permanently flooded habitats.

The whole river course of Piva river was assessed for the identification of Emerald

habitats in Montenegro (Emerald data base from 2008), but only the part downstream of

the dam, which is today in pristine form, was declared as “Emerald European network”.

The question is how the change of micro climate and geomorphology, caused by the

flooding of Morača, will influence two already declared Emerald habitats in Montenegro –

Mrtvica river canyon and Mala rijeka canyon. The flooding of parts of these habitats due

to the inundation of Morača itself is unknown. The loss of habitats and change of

vegetation cover, due to change of climate, will impact on the composition of

ornithofauna of these two canyons, already acknowledged as valuable by the Council of

Europe as Emerald sites.

In the hydrological study for Moraca river and Skadar Lake carried out within the project

Sharing Waters (Knežević, in prep.) it is explained that the construction of the Hydro

Power Plant “Zlatica”, with a dam approximately 75 m high, will imply the creation of

Bioče reservoir. From the information collected on the geomorphology of the area this

reservoir is condemned to lose water due to its karst terrain and the several underground

connections which are unlikely to be interrupted even with serious cement injection

works. This fact would significantly impact the levels of surrounding underground water

systems and potentially create new swamps, vegetation cover and alike, which would in

turn result in changes to the ornithological-faunistic composition. In that case, it is hard to

foresee the future condition downstream, without additional hydro-geological research.

The construction of HE Zlatica would permanently stop the inflow of pebbles through the

Morača canyon which, in addition to the already existing pebble exploitation, would imply

a significant change in the morphology of the waterbed. Zeta river,,the main tributary,

does not bring any sand in fact. Beside the fact that the pebble islets, where

Charadriiformes breed and nourish (Charadrius alexandrinus, Kentish Plover, the most

important breeder of Morača banks, listed in Annex I of Bird Directive) would vanish, the

erosion of Morača river banks in the location of the inflow into the lake and the loss of the

biggest breeding site of Sand Martin, Riparia riparia, in Montenegro located in Zabljacke

meadows would take place. The level of erosion of the banks at the inflow into the lake

and the number of flooded meadows that would be lost by flooding of Morača River are

unimaginably high.




This study is based on field research of ornithofauna carried out in 2008 (without using

literature data).

Based on the facts presented in Part II and summarised in Table8, it would be intolerable

to accept the impacts caused by the construction of dams on Morača River in the river

canyon and Skadar Lake. Such construction would, in fact, be in contradiction with the

national legislation and international conventions that forbid the “destruction of protected

wild species, disturbance, reduction in number of population of protected wild animal

species, destruction or damaging of their habitats or changing of their living conditions”,

which would result from the construction of dams.

ANNEX 1:

Annex 1: IBA criteria

European IBA Criteria

Twenty IBA criteria have been developed for the selection of IBAs in Europe. These

allow the identification of IBAs, based on a site’s international importance for:

- Threatened bird species
- Congregatory bird species
- Assemblages of restricted-range bird species
- Assemblages of biome-restricted bird species

Criteria have been developed such that, by applying different (‘staggered’) numerical

thresholds, the international importance of a site for a species may be categorised at

three distinct geographical levels:

- Global (‘A’ criteria)
- European (‘B’ criteria)
- European Union (‘C’ criteria)

A: Global

A1. Species of global conservation concern

The site regularly holds significant numbers of a globally threatened species, or other

species of global conservation concern.

A2. Restricted-range species

The site is known or thought to hold a significant component of the restricted-range

species whose breeding distributions define an Endemic Bird Area (EBA) or Secondary

Area (SA).

A3. Biome-restricted species

The site is known or thought to hold a significant assemblage of the species whose

breeding distributions are largely or wholly confined to one biome.

A4. Congregations

1. The site is known or thought to hold, on a regular basis, ≥ 1% of a biogeographic

population of a congregatory waterbird species.

1. The site is known or thought to hold, on a regular basis, ≥ 1% of the global

population of a congregatory seabird or terrestrial species.

1. The site is known or thought to hold, on a regular basis, ≥ 20,000 waterbirds or ≥

10,000 pairs of seabird of one or more species.

1. The site is a ‘bottleneck’ site where over 5,000 storks, or over 3,000 raptors or

cranes regularly pass on spring or autumn migration.

B2. Species with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe

The site is one of the 'n' most important in the country for a species with an unfavourable

conservation status in Europe (SPEC 2, 3) and for which the site-protection approach is

thought to be appropriate.

B3. Species with a favourable conservation status in Europe

The site is one of the 'n' most important in the country for a species with a favourable

conservation status in Europe but concentrated in Europe (SPEC 4) and for which the

site-protection approach is thought to be appropriate.

ANNEX 3:

IUCN categories of protected areas


Category Ia

Strict Nature Reserve: Protected Area managed mainly for science.

Area of land and/or sea possessing some outstanding or representative ecosystems, geological

or physiological features and/or species, available primarily for scientific research and/or

environmental monitoring.

Category Ib

Wilderness Area: Protected Area managed mainly for wilderness protection.

Large area of unmodified or slightly modified land and/or sea, retaining its natural character and

influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to

preserve its natural condition.

Category II

National Park: Protected Area managed mainly for ecosystem conservation and

recreation.

Natural area of land and/or sea, designated to

1. protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for this and

future generations:

1. exclude exploitation or occupation inimical to the purposes of designation

of the area: and

1. provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and

visitor opportunities, all of which must be environmentally and culturally compatible.

Category III


Natural Monument: Protected Area managed for conservation of specific natural features.

Area containing one or more specific natural or natural/cultural feature which is of outstanding

value because of its inherent rarity, representative or aesthetic qualities or cultural significance.

Category IV

Habitat/Species Management Area: Protected Area managed mainly for conservation

through management intervention.

Area of land and/or sea subject to active intervention for management purposes so as to ensure

the maintenance of habitats and/or to meet the requirements of specific species.

Category V

Protected Landscape/Seascape: Protected Areas managed mainly for landscape/seascape

conservation and recreation.

Area of land, with coast and seas as appropriate, where the interaction of people and nature over

time has produced an area of distinct character with significant aesthetic, cultural and/or

ecological value, and often with high biological diversity. Safeguarding the integrity of this

traditional interaction is vital to the protection, maintenance and evolution of such an area.

Category VI

Managed Resource Protected Areas: Protected Area managed mainly for the sustainable

use of natural ecosystems.

Area containing predominantly unmodified natural systems, managed to ensure long term

protection and maintenance of biological diversity, while providing at the same time a sustainable

flow of natural products and services to meet community needs.

Mikri Prespa in Greece, successful story of pelican protection and a model for

Skadar Lake

Mikri Prespa is located in Greece, at an altitude of 850 meters, with the surface of 54 km2

and average depth 6.7m.

First data on pelicans’ breeding in Mikri Prespa date from 1968 (Terrasse et all, 1969)

Before the active protection of this species started on the lake, main protection problems

and successfulness of breeding of this species used to be disturbance, in particular by

fishermen and visitors, variations of water level causing erosion and destroying natural

islets for breeding. If the list would be supplemented with disturbance by hunters, one

could say that we had rather similar starting position for protection of pelicans.

In 1990, 500-550 pairs of pelicans (two large colonies in Mikri Prespa and Amvrakikos

Bay) bred in the whole Greece, (Crivelli et al, 2000). By active protection of pelicans on

Mikri Prespa that included reduction of disturbance, strict restriction of access to the

colony and zoning of the lake, especially for fishermen and visitors, colonies

management and establishment of water level management, number of breeding pairs

increased from a hundred pairs in 1988 to more than 1000 pairs in 2008. Mikri Prespa

became the largest world colony of this species (see table). Impact of water level

variations is reduced to minimum by construction of platforms for breeding. As Pančeva

oka and Crni žar cover the entire surface of Mikri Prespe, in that case is not possible to

talk about construction of artificial breeding sites but it is better to tackle the cause which

means regulation of water level variations.

Tab. Number of breeding pairs of Dalmatian Pelican, Pelecanus crispus on Mikri

Prespa in the period 1991-2007




In order to prevent any kind of disturbance of the colony during the breeding period,

Greek ornithologists ceased any entry in the colony until the beginning of July, which also

contributed to significant successfulness of this species breeding.

This opportunity was used by White Pelicans, Pelecanus onocrotalus whose colony grew

to more than 400 pairs.
